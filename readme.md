### Addendum to PSA Report: Detailing the Release of Oil in Shoreside Spill Containment Trays

**Incident Overview:**

- **Type of Incident:** Release of oil into shoreside containment system.
- **Time of Incident:** 00:00 local time, February 22nd, 2015.
- **Vessel Details:**
  - **Name:** SCF Pearl
  - **IMO:** 9577109
  - **Movement Number:** 1555154

**Event Synopsis:**

At the conclusion of a loading operation, a sudden surge in pressure was experienced by the draining arm, leading to an overflow of the shoreside sump. This resulted in the release of oil into the open spill containment system on the shoreside. Crucially, there was no oil spillage on the vessel side, nor was any equipment damaged due to the incident. Furthermore, there were no injuries reported, and there was no oil detected in the adjacent water.

In addition to the oil spill, there was a measurable atmospheric release of benzene, ranging between 7 to 10 parts per million (PPM). The total volume of the product spilled into the containment system was approximately one barrel per TPIC. 

Subsequent to the incident, the vessel completed draining their side and closed the drain line, allowing for shoreside drainage to resume and complete successfully. The Valero superintendent, along with a spill response team, arrived on the scene shortly after the incident occurred. 

**Immediate Response:**

The swift response of the Valero superintendent and the dedicated spill response team was critical in managing the situation effectively. Their presence ensured that the necessary measures were implemented promptly to contain and assess the spill incident. 

**Further Actions:**

- Continued monitoring of the containment system to ensure spillage does not reach waterways.
- Assessing and addressing any potential environmental impact due to the benzene release.
- Reviewing and updating existing procedures to prevent future occurrences of similar incidents.

This section of the report serves to provide a detailed account of the incident, the responses undertaken, and measures for improved operational protocols.

### Incident Report: Vessel Pressure Mishap 

**Incident Overview:**
On the date of the incident, it was noted that there was no significant delay attributed directly to the incident itself. However, TPIC Ian suggested that there might have been a slight delay concerning the 65 Roses due to the clean-up and inspection processes following the incident. The total quantity spilled was contained to one barrel within a containment tray.

**Weather Conditions:**
- Visibility: Excellent
- Tide: Moderate ebb
- Wind: Negligible
- Temperature: 48Â°F

**Key Personnel:**
- **Vessel Manager:** SCF Group
- **Persons in Charge (PICs) at Time of Incident:** 
  - Chief Officer Evgeniy Petrov
  - TPIC Roscoe Keller
- **Local Agent:** GAC (Contact: Ian, Phone: 510-242-4347)

**Technical Details:**
- **Tank Pressure at Time of Incident:** 
  - 0.58 PSI (0.041 bar)
- All tank vents were functioning as common vents.
- Both manifold and shoreside valves were closed at the time.
- Pressure/Vacuum (P/V) valves appeared to be fully operational.
- The drain line was noted to be six inches in diameter; however, the entire length was not traced.
- The vessel reportedly did not have a diaphragm pump in the MARPOL line.
- There were no reported equipment failures, and the Inert Gas (IG) padding was within normal operating parameters.

**Cause of Incident:**
According to the vessel's Captain and Chief Officer, the incident occurred due to pressure buildup when both the manifold and the shore-side valves were closed. This scenario led to back pressure forming in the space between the two closed valve points, which likely contributed to the incident.

## Incident Analysis and Observations

### Incident Overview

During the unloading process, an unexpected rise in pressure was observed in the system, resulting in an overflow incident. According to Mr. Keller, the draining process initially proceeded in a steady and controlled manner for five minutes. However, the system experienced a sudden pressure spike, believed to be caused by the vessel's unexpected pressure introduction.

### Key Observations

1. **Initial Pressure Management**: 
   - The pressure was managed steadily for the first few minutes. However, an unforeseen pressure surge interrupted the process, leading to system overflow.

2. **Delayed Draining Notification**:
   - The Chief Officer (CO) notified the Terminal Person in Charge (TPIC) post-discharge about a delay in draining the arm until the designated drain tank was available for ullage. This may have contributed to the issue as the system was not aligned with the adjusted timeline.

3. **Unusual System Pressure**:
   - When attempting to allow suction through the bleed valve, pressure was detected instead of the expected vacuum. This anomaly was immediately reported to both the Chief Officer and the TPIC, indicating a malfunction in the normal operation of the system pressure.

4. **Diaphragm Pump Absence**:
   - It was observed that a diaphragm pump, sometimes used to facilitate product movement back to the tank, was absent. The absence of pump noise suggested the vessel may have employed gravity feed methods. This alternative could potentially explain why, if the line was packed, tank pressure might have aggressively forced the product back via the shore drain.

### Unresolved Factors

Despite assessments and observations, the exact cause of the overpressure remains undetermined. Further investigation is required to determine the root cause of the pressure surge during the unloading process. 

### Recommendations and Future Considerations

1. Conduct a comprehensive audit of the system's pressure control mechanisms to identify potential vulnerabilities that could lead to unanticipated pressure surges.
2. Implement regular maintenance checks and drills to ensure all personnel are prepared and all equipment is functioning properly, particularly in transitioning between pumps and gravity feed methods.
3. Enhance communication protocols among ship and shore personnel to ensure timely notifications of operational changes, avoiding potential pipeline pressure mismatches.

### Event Mitigation Strategies

To address potential issues during operational processes, several mitigation strategies can be implemented to minimize risks and ensure safety. One such measure is allowing the vessel to commence draining before engaging in further procedures. This step could significantly reduce the likelihood of adverse events, as it provides a controlled environment to manage pressure changes within the system.

#### Diaphragm Pump Utilization

Additionally, the use of a diaphragm pump on the vessel-side drain line is recommended. This equipment can facilitate a more gradual and measured introduction of pressure into the system, thereby lowering the risk of sudden pressure spikes that could compromise safety and operational efficiency.
